	<p class="text-justify">Hello, Matters! is a registered non-government organization, founded in 2020 by Theresya Chesilya.
We do absolutely everything to support children in need and to promote equal education.. Their mission is to address suffering and ensure that all forms of education are valued equally.
Hello, Matters! believes that every child deserves access to quality education, regardless of their background or circumstances. They understand that education is the key to unlocking a child's potential and providing them with the tools they need to succeed in life. However, they also recognize that not all children have equal access to education, and that many face significant challenges that make it difficult for them to succeed.
To address these issues, Hello, Matters! provides a range of support services to children in need. This may include financial assistance to help cover the cost of school fees, tutoring and mentoring programs to help children catch up on missed learning, and advocacy efforts to raise awareness about the challenges that children face and to push for policy changes that will make education more accessible and equitable.</p>
<p>
Until suffering is no longer ignored; until all education are valued equally</p>
